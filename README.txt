Learning Objectives of KissaVocab:

The goal of KissaVocab is to provide an additional platform for Nina Langton's students to engage with the vocabulary they are learning in class. This is achieved using games based on a multiple choice question style model, with varying objectives like accuracy, speed and repetition. By encouraging students to interact with the vocabulary outside of their lectures, it is the hope that the vocabulary may become easier to recall, recognize, and work with in the future.
